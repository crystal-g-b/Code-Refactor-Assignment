# Code-Refactor-Assignment

## Overview of Assignment

For this project we were given a perfectly functioning webpage to be refracted so that it would be easier for other coders to use. Refracting it also meant that the page would function the same as the original styling for the source code. 

The key goals were to ensure that the css had the proper structure and order since CSS heavilly relies on order, mainly order of presidence and specifity. 

Another goal was to ensure that there was no unnecessary repititions of styling.

### The following are steps I took to help improve the CSS of given webpage

* I first revised the class header and made it a header tag. This made it easier to adjust the styling of the h1 elements

* I then grouped all the h2 tags together and removed the repeated tags in the css file

* I then grouped all the h3 tags and removed repeated tags in CSS file

* I removed the float right and float let class from the img attributes and revised it to alt attributes. This is helpful in cases where images aren't visible on the webpage, verbage is substitued to help the user know what the image should be.

* Grouped all the benefit images under one class. This removed excess repetitive styling.

* I then added an attribute selector to the images for the benefits class. This allowed me to style the images under one attribute.

* I also updated the margin in the benefits class and added a .lead class to the first h3 so that I could adjust the margin accordingly. It would need to have a separate margin from the other h3 based on the spacing on the original web page.

* I then changed the divs to sections in the html file, which made it easier for me to manipulate and style the elements and images in the content class.

* Lastly, I adjusted the font size for the h1 tag and revised the order of the heading attributes. And also added variables just incase another coder would like to change the colors of multiple attributes.

All these adjustments help to make the css file cleaner and easier to read. 

### This is what the webpage should look like
